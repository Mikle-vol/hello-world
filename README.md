# hello-world
The first GitHub repository of mine aimed to bring me some expirience of using GitHub service.

## A bit about myself (following the GitHub "hello world" guide):
1. ### Living in **Munich**
2. ### Student of a Technical University of Munich *(TUM)*
3. ### Doing sport `:)`

*I know how to write a "Hello world!" program in python*
*`print("Hello world!")`*
